This is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree.
Comes with two classes, BSTNode which represents a node in the binary search tree. Also comes with BSTree, the actual Binary Search Tree class. Several methods are supported. Nodes can be inserted, deleted and found.<br>
***Please note, this has no comments and does not have an inorder, preorder, postorder method yet, this is only version 0.5. I just got tired of seeing only two versions of BST in the Java section of PSC and made my own. I hope you find this helpful. Give me feedback!***
