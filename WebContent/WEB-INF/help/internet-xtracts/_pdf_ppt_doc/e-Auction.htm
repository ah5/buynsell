<P><SPAN class=GramE><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I></B></SPAN> is a startup 
company which wants to pursue the exploding opportunities of on-line auction 
business. Hilbert Dude, the founder of this startup, has monitored the 
development of e-business market for a while and identified <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Bay</I> as the primary market leader to 
beat. He decided to adopt this business model and managed to convince some rich 
dudes (in the Dude Family) to sponsor an initial round of funding and is ready 
to fly. <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Mr. Dude is not a technical person, so he decides to find a technical team to 
prototype and validate his business ideas. The approach is to propose a design 
and explore the feasibility of the design through prototyping. The goal is not 
to produce a complete implementation of the system, as this would require too 
much time and money than the initial funding can support. Instead, Mr. Dude 
likes the team to focus on the parts of the design that pose a significant risk, 
or that involve a lot of uncertainty. Based on evaluation and testing on the 
prototype, the design can be improved later to better meet the requirements. 
This design-prototype approach is often adopted when the requirements are not 
well understood or the method of achieving them is not clear. On the other hand, 
a successful prototype can serve as the foundation for future production system 
in operation and will help to secure the next round of funding. </P>
<P>Since Mr. Dude is not very technically savvy, he tries to communicate his 
visions with the technical team and expects the team to figure out all the 
missing details. Basically, the technical team will design a database 
application to manage the on-line auction business of e-Auction. You will 
implement a prototype to demonstrate system functions and your design. As part 
of the prototype, you will need to write several transactions to access the 
database in order to support the functions required for the system. The project 
consists of three phases: </P>

conceptual database design by using entity-relationship model. The second phase 
is to decide which database management system to use, create a logical database

populate the database, write a set of representative transactions to access the 
database, and implement the application.</P><B><SPAN

<P>As mentioned earlier, <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I> is 
aiming at on-line auction business. Thus, it may help to explore the eBay 
on-line auction website (<A 
href="http://www.ebay.com/">http://www.ebay.com/</A>) to better understand their 
functions and the requirements for e-Auction. The following is a description of 
some basic requirements, including the types of information that must be stored 
and how it will be accessed.</P>
<P><B><I>Auction Items-</I></B> The focus here is the items posted for bidding. 
These items, pretty much anything, are sold by auction. The sources of the items 
may be a company or an individual. A unique identifier is assigned to an item 
when it is put up for auction. A short description (no more then 400 characters) 
is associated with an item (provided by a company or an individual seller). In 
addition, a URL may be provided to link to a more detailed description at the 
company’s or individual’s websites. The seller may specify a <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reserve price</I> (which is hidden from the 
buyers) for an item he posted for auction. A reserve price is the minimum price 
a seller is willing to accept for the item. At the end of the auction, if no bid 
is higher than the reserve price, the seller is not obligated to sell the item. 
The seller must also specify the location of the item (i.e., the State it would 
be shipped from). <o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Categories- </I></B>The items available at <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I> are categorized using a 
predefined classification tree. Each node represents a set of items. The root of 
the tree, labeled as ‘All’, represents all items. Each node has on average 
fifteen children (subcategories). Each, with a descriptive name, represents some 
subset of the items represented by the parent. An item can be specified by a 
path through this classification tree. For example, we may categorize an item 
as:<o:p></o:p></P>
<OL type=1>
  <OL type=1>
    <LI class=MsoNormal 
    style="tab-stops: list 1.0in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level2 lfo1">Books 
    &gt; Audio Books; or 
    <LI class=MsoNormal 
    style="tab-stops: list 1.0in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level2 lfo1">Cameras 
    &amp; Photo &gt; Digital Cameras &gt; Digital SLR &gt; Nikon; or 
    <LI class=MsoNormal 
    style="tab-stops: list 1.0in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level2 lfo1">Collectibles 
    &gt; Postcards &amp; Paper &gt; Postcards &gt; Artist Signed; or 
    <LI class=MsoNormal 
    style="tab-stops: list 1.0in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level2 lfo1">Clothing, 
    Shoes &amp; Accessories &gt; Girls &gt; Shoes. </LI></OL></OL>
<P>The depth of the tree varies but is no more than ten levels 
deep.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Registered Users-</I></B> To sell or bid on an item, a user must be 
registered. A registered user is identified by a user name and authenticated 
with a password. In addition, the maintained information includes, e-mail 
address, name, address (which consists of street, city, state, and zip), phone 
number, credit card information (including type of credit card, credit card 
number, expiration date), age, gender, annual income, and etc. The last three 
items are collected solely for telemarketers (but we won’t tell the users that). 
Also, there could be more than one address and credit card for each user. 
<B><I><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN><o:p></o:p></I></B></P>
<P><B><I>Companies-</I></B> Companies can be considered as a special kind of 
users (i.e., credit card information is not needed). All the companies selling 
items at <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I> are maintained in 
the database. Company information includes company name, address, point of 
contact (person), phone number, company category, revenue, etc. <o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rating-</I></B> We attempt to control fraud 
by allowing users to comment on the past behavior of other users. A user that 
took part in an auction can rate the other user in a scale of 1 to 10. These 
ratings and a short explanation (less than 250 characters) are then made 
available to other users. In this way, a user’s reputation is forced to precede 
him.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Browsing-</I></B> Users are able to browse the items by traversing the 
category tree. At each point, they are given a summary of all the items that 
appear in that category.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Searching-</I></B> Users are able to search the items by entering some 
keywords or conditions (e.g., price range). As a search result, a list of items 
that satisfy the search criteria is returned to the user. </P>
<P><B><I>Bidding-</I></B> A user can place one or more bids on an item as long 
as they are not the seller of the item. (You can assume <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">simple bidding</I> rather than the <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">proxy bidding</I> used on eBay.) Each bid 
must be at least 5% higher than the last bid and must be placed before the 
auction ends. At the end of the auction the seller and all bidders are notified 
of the highest bid and the user that placed it. Contact information is sent to 
the seller and highest bidder so that they can complete the transaction. An 
auction starts when the seller registers the item for auction and ends exactly 
two weeks later. Information about an auction in which the item is not sold can 
be discarded immediately.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><SPAN class=SpellE><B><I>BuyItNow</I></B></SPAN><B><I>- </I></B><SPAN 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">A customer can 
purchase an item based on the listed <SPAN class=SpellE><I>BuyItNow</I></SPAN> 
price instead of going through the auction process.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><I>Auction Statistics- </I></B><SPAN 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Periodically 
(every week), a report summarizing the statistics of auctioned items based on 
categories of items are generated. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I>Delivery-</I></B> The process of completing an auction is complicated. 
<SPAN class=GramE><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I></SPAN> 
will serve as a trusted third party to ensure the payment and goods are properly 
delivered to the seller and the buyer. After a winner in the auction has been 
announced, the seller will ship the item to e-Auction. When and if the item is 
received, <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I> places a charge 
on the credit card the user supplied. If the charge is successful, the item is 
forwarded to the buyer and a check is mailed to the seller. If the item does not 
arrive in two weeks, or the charge does not go through<I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">, e-Auction</I> declares the auction void 
and, if necessary, returns the item. Information about auctions that are 
successful will be maintained in the system for at least six months. Information 
about successful and voided delivery cannot be discarded until six months after 
e-mails are sent to all parties notifying them of the outcome. To support the 
removal of this information, information regarding to when notifications were 
sent needs to be maintained.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Reports to Telemarketers-</I></B> Periodically, a report including the 
name, address, e-mail, phone, age, gender and annual income is sent to a 
telemarketing firm. <o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Questions-</I></B> Mr. Dude has tried to specify as much details as he 
could to get the project start. However, if your team needs more details please 
contact<SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Times; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> the chief

(FAQ) list will be maintained on the class web page to broadcast his 
answers.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B>Project Report<o:p></o:p></B></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The deliverable for Phase 1 of the

You should produce a refined schema that reduces redundancy to an acceptable

the functional dependencies) and the previous one. I will leave the specific

to apply some combination of translating the ER components to relations and 
normalization.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

submit a report that describes your ER design from the first phase with 
corrections based on your own and our evaluation. In addition, you should

transforming ER components (i.e., entity set, relationship set, constraints, 
etc) to relation schema; 2) specify new integrity constraints such as functional 
dependency; and 3) refining the schema through normalization. In the report, I 
also expect you to describe how the created tables are related to your ER design

Description<o:p></o:p></SPAN></B></P>
<P>During this phase of the project you will implement the database system you 
have previously designed for <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I>. You will create a database in 
Oracle based on your design and populate it with testing data you generate. In 
addition, you will implement several database transactions for the internal 
and/or external user operations of <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I>.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B>Populating the Database<o:p></o:p></B></P>
<P>The first task is to create and populate the database you designed for <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I>. You should create all of the 
necessary tables defining primary keys, foreign keys, and any integrity 
constraints you feel helpful. In addition, define any views of the schema you 
will need. Because the designs proposed by the various groups are not uniform, I 
will not provide a set of data for you to load. Instead, you should develop a 
method of loading your database that satisfies the following requirements. Some 
sample data for the <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I> 
database include:<o:p></o:p></P>

or a one of the three levels.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Note that the above are just some sample data. Please include any other data 
needed to adequately demonstrate the transactions you write for the operation of 
<I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">e-Auction</I>. You should produce one or 
more SQL scripts so that you can easily restore the database 
states.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B>Transactions<o:p></o:p></B></P>
<P>The next task is to implement each of the following 
transactions.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN 
class=SpellE><B>RigisterUser</B></SPAN><B>:</B> This is for registering a new 
user. Acquire necessary information from user and enter into database. Remember, 
the information we supply to the Telemarketer’s is REQUIRED (How do you expect 
us to make money?). Please be sure that the user’s password is not displayed 
while it is being entered.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN 
class=SpellE><B>AddAuctionItem</B></SPAN><B>:</B> This is used to place an item 
up for auction. Enter all necessary items into the database, acquiring whatever 
information you require from the user. Only a registered user can execute this 
transaction. You need to verify that the user knows the appropriate 
password.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN 
class=SpellE><B>BrowsingItems</B></SPAN><B>:</B> This really constitutes an 
extended interaction with the user that consists of several transactions. The 
session begins by displaying the root category name together with its 
subcategories. Following each category name is the number of items in the 
category. An example is given below:<o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><I><U>All (299<SPAN class=GramE>)<SPAN

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">By clicking on the category left of the colon, the 
items in that category are displayed. Clicking on a category on the right, 
replaces the display with one in which the selected category is on the left of 
the colon and its subcategories are on the right.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">Note that the above is just an example for 
illustration. You can easily create a design better than the example, so come up 
with your own design!<o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN 
class=SpellE><B>SearchingItems</B></SPAN><B>:</B> Users are able to search the 
items by entering some keywords or conditions (e.g., price range). As a search 
result, a list of items that satisfy the search criteria is returned to the 
user. <o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN class=SpellE><B>BidItem</B></SPAN><B>:</B> A 
registered user (must authenticate user by checking password) specifies a bid on 
an item. The item is specified using its item identifier. A bid is rejected and 
the bidder is notified if the amount does not exceed the previous high bid by at 
least 5% (round it to cent), or if the bid does not exceed the reserve price for 
the item.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN 
class=SpellE><B>TerminateAuction</B></SPAN><B>:</B> This is executed at the end 
of each day to terminate all auctions that finished during the day. It does not 
use a web interface so a normal Java application or a C with embedded SQL 
application can be used. It must locate all auctions that finished. For each 
item, it must determine whether the item was sold or not. If it was not sold, 
all information about the item and auction will be removed from the database 
immediately. The transaction should generate e-mail notifications to all sellers 
and bidders concerning the outcome of the auction. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN 
class=SpellE><B>SendCustomerInfo</B></SPAN><B>:</B> Periodically, a report 
including the name, address, e-mail, phone, age, gender and annual income is 
sent to a telemarketing firm.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B>General Constraints<o:p></o:p></B></P>
<P>Because the interaction with a user can be quite time consuming, you should 
divide database interactions into short transactions.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Project Report-</I> </B>You should submit a cumulative report that 
describes your ER design, schema refinement and implementation. Discuss any 
important implementation issues you considered and discuss any details of the 
design you feel noteworthy. Include listing of all your source code in the 
appendix. You will be asked to demonstrate your project to the TA or 
myself.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B><I>Formatting-</I></B> Your document, not including appendices should be 
no more than thirty-five double-space pages. Please note that this document 
extends your previous documents and for that reason you should incorporate them 
(with the proper corrections) into a coherent form. Your document must have page 
numbers, section numbers and a table of contents. Your document should include 
(in an appendix) a clearly formatted summary of individual and group progress 
reports from the beginning of the semester until the due date.<o:p></o:p></P>
