<td>
Each item in an auction has an estimated value range as provided by SoldUSA. The minimum opening bid for each item is 50% of the lowest estimated value for that item. If an estimated value is not provided for an item, the minimum opening bid is $1.00. Bids are only accepted in whole dollar increments and partial dollar bids are rounded up to the next whole dollar. All bids registered will must be denominated in US Dollars. If a registered bid is tied, the first bid registered will be accepted as the winning bid. Occasionally the catalogue description number does not match the photograph number. To ensure that your bid is properly entered, always bid based on the catalogue description number, not the photograph number. Winning bids must be in an amount greater than the reserve established by the Seller, provided that such a reserve is set.

Bid Advancement

<tr>
<td>
Bids are advanced in minimum increments of 5% of the last bid registered. Fractional amounts are raised to the next whole dollar. Advancements made in less than 5% increments will not be accepted. Received spread bids that exceed the current bid or another bidder's spread will win the item even if the 5% rule is not met if, in the opinion of the auctioneer, the raise was made in good faith and exceeds the other's spread by a sufficient amount as not to cause ill will.

Optional Automatic Increase of Spread Bids

<td>
You can elect to have the Service automatically place bids for you up to a selected maximum bid amount. By inserting an amount in the maximum bid block, you indicate to the Service that you wish to continuously bid in the required minimum increments until the bidding reaches the amount inserted in the maximum bid block. The maximum bid will not be published or displayed to any other users. For example, the current bid on an item is $50.00 and you wish to bid on this item up to a maximum bid amount of $100.00. If activated, the Service will automatically increase your bid incrementally by 5% to outbid the highest bid at any given point. This process will continue until either: a) your bid becomes the winning bid, or b) the bidding surpasses your maximum bid amount of $100.00
