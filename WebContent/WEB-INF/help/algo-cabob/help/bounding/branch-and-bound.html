<P> Branch and Bound is a general search method.  Suppose we wish to
minimize a function f(x),
where x is restricted to some feasible region (defined, e.g., by
explicit mathematical constraints).  To apply branch and bound, one
must have a means of computing a lower bound on an instance of the
optimization problem and a means of dividing the feasible region of a
problem to create smaller subproblems.  There must also be a way to
compute an upper bound (feasible solution) for at least some
instances;  for practical purposes, it should be possible to compute
upper bounds for some set of nontrivial feasible regions. </P>

<P> The method starts by considering the original problem with
the complete feasible region, which is called the root problem.  The
lower-bounding and upper-bounding procedures are applied to the root
problem.  If the bounds match, then an optimal solution has been
found and the procedure terminates.  Otherwise, the feasible region is
divided into two or more regions, each strict subregions of the
original, which together cover the whole feasible region;  ideally,
these subproblems partition the feasible region.  These subproblems
become children of the root search node.  The algorithm is applied
recursively to the subproblems, generating a tree of subproblems.  If
an optimal solution is found to a subproblem, it is a feasible
solution to the full problem, but not necessarily globally optimal.
Since it is feasible, it can be used to prune the rest of the tree: if
the lower bound for a node exceeds the best known feasible solution,
no globally optimal solution can exist in the subspace of the feasible
region represented by the node.  Therefore, the node can be removed
from consideration.  The search proceeds until all nodes have been
solved or pruned, or until some specified threshold is meet between
the best solution found and the lower bounds on all unsolved
subproblems.  </P>
